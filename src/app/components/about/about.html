            Nordic Walking is relatively new to Australia but practised widely in
            Europe, the U.K. and the U.S.A. Its origins are in cross-country skiing,
            as the name suggests. It is a fitness activity utilising specially
            designed poles and a technique which activates 90% of the body’s muscles.
            It can be done on a variety of surfaces including footpaths, grass, sand
            and bush tracks.
            <br><br>
            It is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels as well as those
            living with chronic medical conditions. Before commencing any exercise
            program, it is advisable to get the go-ahead from a medical professional.
            <br><br>
            As an instructor and regular Nordic Walker, I promote Nordic Walking as
            a way of keeping the brain healthy and reducing the risk of dementia.
            Learning Nordic Walking is simultaneously mentally, physically and socially
            stimulating. Activities that combine these 3 elements have been shown to
            be particularly beneficial for brain health.
            <br><br>
            To obtain the benefits of Nordic Walking listed below, it is important to
            learn the correct technique from a qualified instructor.

          <p>
            I am a keen Nordic Walker and have been instructing since 2011. In
            2012, I worked as a Nordic Walking instructor with the City of
            Cockburn, running 2 groups for seniors as part of the Co-Health
            Program.  Since 2009, I have run Heart Foundation Walking groups
            offering Nordic Walking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently studying Preventive Health at the University of
            Notre Dame Australia at the Fremantle campus. Nordic Walking fits
            very well with my passion for brain health and reducing the risk of
            dementia. It involves cognitive stimulation, a physical workout and
            social interaction as it’s usually done in a group.  Research shows
            that combining these 3 components is beneficial for the brain.
          </p>

            Essential Nordic Walking has been established to introduce Nordic
            Walking to as many West Australians as possible. My approach to Nordic
            Walking instruction is tailored to the individual needs of each client.
             For this reason, I teach in small groups of up to 6 walkers and I
             can cater for people of all ages and fitness levels.  You will find
             me an outgoing and sociable person whose enthusiasm for Nordic Walking
             is motivating.
